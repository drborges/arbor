☐ Move stale node check into Arbor#mutate so it is centralized
☐ Throw an error when attempting to mutate a stale node as oppposed to ignoring the mutation
☐ Tackle code TODOs
☐ Look for improvement areas around:
  ☐ readability
  ☐ abstraction extractions
  ☐ release process
  ☐ documentation
  ☐ spec coverage
  ☐ streamline specs: they're a bit confusing at the moment
